Hi, I’m Kürşat Yurt, a doctoral candidate at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).

My work centers on mid-fidelity aerodynamics, aeromechanics, and high-performance computing, with an emphasis on performance-portable simulation frameworks for rotorcraft and eVTOL applications.

I’m particularly interested in bridging physical modeling and scalable software design—developing numerical methods that balance accuracy, computational efficiency.
